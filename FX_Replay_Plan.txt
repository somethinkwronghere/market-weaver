FX Replay Style Futures Trading Transformation Plan

1. GOAL DESCRIPTION

  - /analytics
  - /dashboard
  - /live
  - /strategies
  - /settings


- Create a MainLayout containing the Left Sidebar.
  - Profile Section: Avatar, Username, Plan (Free/Pro).
  - Navigation Menu: Testing, Live, Strategies, Settings.

2.2. Chart Page (The "Sim" Engine)
Refactor `Index.tsx` into a robust `ChartPage`.
